# ATM_Neueda
This is an ATM machine built on java.

I have created a GUI ATM machine. It showcases my object orientation knowledge in java. I have used desgin pattern and MVC approach for it.

Functionality like cash deposit, transaction history and user details which I thougt could be a part of ATM machine have been added.

Since the assignment brief does not included the '1' currency notes. There is a clause in the code which only processes the amounts divisilbe by 5.

I have never used Docker before. Due to the time constraint I managed to create a docker file which does not completely works. I didn't include a databse as I didn't know how 
was it going to work with Docker. But, for the Jar file the invigilator should have been running the local sql server which I thought was not very convinient. 

In place of that I have attached a Runnable Jar File for the execution of the code.

I have never done unit tests for GUI so I could not include them this time.

Hope you will like it.
